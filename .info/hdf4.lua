HDF4 (also known as HDF) is a library and multi-object file format for
storing and managing data between machines. There are two versions of
HDF technologies that are completely different: HDF4 and HDF5. HDF4 is
the first HDF format.

PLEASE NOTE that although HDF4 is still funded, new products should be
developed in HDF5.
