The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free
software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in the
JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1). This project was
started as a collaborative effort between Image Power, Inc. and the
University of British Columbia. Presently, the ongoing maintenance
and development of the JasPer software is being coordinated by its
principal author, Michael Adams, who is affiliated with the Digital
Signal Processing Group (DSPG) in the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering at the University of Victoria.
