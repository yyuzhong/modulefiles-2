Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming
language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of
code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on
both a small and large scale.
